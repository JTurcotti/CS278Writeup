\section*{Examples of Reductions for CSP problems}
In this section, we present two specific examples of proofs showing the UGC implies a particular hardness result for CSPs. The general framework of the reduction is as follows: Suppose we want to show that $UGC$ implies it is NP-hard to solve the $(1-\alpha, c+\gamma)$ version of a particular $CSP$ problem. for any $\alpha, \gamma > 0$ (i.e. $c$ is the best constant approximation factor).: Start with arbitrary instance of Unique Label Cover, $\mathcal{I}$. Use it to construct a PCP verifier for the $CSP$ problem such that:
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
            \item if $OPT(\mathcal{I}) > 1-\epsilon$, then $P[Accept] \geq 1-\alpha(\epsilon)$
            \item if $OPT(\mathcal{I}) \leq \delta$, then $P[Accept] \leq c(\delta)$
\end{enumerate}
Where $\alpha(\epsilon), c+\gamma(\delta)\rightarrow 0$ as $\epsilon,\delta\rightarrow 0$. Then, use the PCP verifier to construct an instance, $\mathcal{I}'$ of the $CSP$ such that $OPT(\mathcal{I}') = P[Accept]$. Then solving the $(1-\alpha, c+\gamma)$ gap version of the CSP problem implies solving the $(1-\epsilon, \delta)$ version of the original Unique label cover problem, which, by the $UGC$ is $NP-$hard.
\subsection*{Max-3-Lin:}
The problem $Max-3-Lin$ is as follows. Given a set of constraints of the form $x_i + x_j + x_j = c \mod 2$, we want to find an assignment to the variables $x_i$ that satisfies the most number of constraints. Note that if we apply the transformation $x\mapsto (-1)^x$, the constraints take the form of $y_iy_jy_k = d$ for $y_i,y_j,y_k,d\in \{-1,1\}$. We will use the product convention as it makes the Fourier Analysis much easier.
